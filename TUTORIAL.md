# My-first-chrome-extension-
Here, I have created a chrome extension to change the background color of your chrome webpages. It has about 92 color options to choose from!
Now you just need to follow the steps given below to add this extension to your browser:
- Go to chrome://extensions.
- Then, switch on "Developer Mode".
- Click on the "Load Unpacked" button on the top-left corner.
- Select the folder which contains all your codes and the icon images and load it (make sure to create a folder before-hand in your desired directory and add all the HTML5, CSS, JavaScript codes and icon images to that.)
- You have added your extension! 
- To run it, just open a fresh tab and click on the extensions logo to pin this extension onto your taskbar so that you can access it easily.
- When you click on it, the default color that'll be shown to you is BLACK.
- If you want to change the color, just right-click on our extension logo and select "Options" from the drop-down menu.
- Now the "options" page will open up and you'll be provided with 92 color options to choose from!
